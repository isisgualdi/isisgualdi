## 🧭 About Me

I'm currently a Psychology undergraduate with a background in Information Science. My journey bridges psychology and data.

I explore:
- How neuroscience informs education and therapeutic practices  
- How data science can support evidence-based psychology  
- How we can design better tools for learning, self-knowledge, and mental health

I’m building a public learning journey through writing, code, and content.
